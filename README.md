# Quantum-Classical_Hybrid_Q-Kernel_MultiClass-Classifier-Emotion_detection
Quantum-Classical_Hybrid_Neural Network Multi Class-Classifier : Emotion detection model, based on Pennylane. 


This repository contains the implementation of a Quantum-Classical Hybrid Machine Learning Model that combines BERT embeddings with a Quantum Kernel-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) to perform emotion classification using the GoEmotions dataset.

This particular version uses 250 samples for rapid prototyping and demonstration. The repository also includes experiments with 1000-sample, 5000-sample, and 53,000-sample datasets, along with failed iterations (like Decision Tree models) and a dedicated log file explaining the rationale behind each iteration and why some approaches did not succeed.

# Description
The goal of this project is to explore the potential of quantum-enhanced machine learning using quantum kernels on NLP-based emotion classification tasks. By leveraging BERT's sentence embeddings and quantum feature maps, we aim to test whether quantum kernels can provide an advantage over classical models in low-data regimes.
